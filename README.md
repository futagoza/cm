This is a collection of modules usable in [Node.js v6+](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v6.0.0/) environments, with a selected subset of these packages usable in most browsers via a transformer (e.g. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) and [package bundlers](#package-bundlers).

## Install

### cm packages

I recommend adding any package from this repo to your `dependencies` field in your `package.json` for most cases, but if you plan to develop a package for the browser and your using a [package bundler](#package-bundlers), add them to your `devDependencies` field instead.

### repository

Your going to need [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Node.js v6+](https://nodejs.org/)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/futagoza/cm.git
cd cm
yarn install
```

## Documentation

You'll find the documentation (if any) for each package in their [respective directories](https://github.com/futagoza/cm/tree/master/packages) and/or `README.md` file.

## Package bundlers

It is recommended to use a package (or if you prefer, _web application_) bundler in your projects build setup, so that you can cherry pick the modules you want to use from these packages via imports (that's what I made them for üòÑ). I recommend using one of these three:

* [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## History

The package's in this repository simply started as single file utility modules that I copy-pasted into other projects whenever I needed them. In 2012 I decided to make a dedicated package on NPM (first [common](https://www.npmjs.com/package/comman), later [cm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cm)) that I would just include via the `dependencies` field in my `package.json` files, but in less then a year it became a hassle to maintain as I wasn't the type to manage multiple projects. That has changed since late 2017 when I was able to give more time to some of my local projects; not to mention I'm really starting to need a set of central utility packages, so here's for attempt 5 üç∫
